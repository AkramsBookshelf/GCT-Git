# 📜 GIT For Game Development

Now that we've discussed the importance of **[!version control systems (VCS)](VersionControl.md)** and why Git is one of the best solutions for beginners, we need to get it ready for action. Before we even open a game development project, we must set up our environment. Understanding version control in theory is one thing, but mastering the ecosystem is what separates a hobbyist from a professional developer. Especially in game development, where high-res textures and 3D models can easily break a standard repository, knowing how to configure your tools correctly from day one is the difference between a smooth workflow and a corrupted project. In this lesson, we will install the essential toolkit and configure your environment to handle everything from simple scripts to massive game assets.

## Git Vs GitHub

As a beginner, you might often hear "Git" and "GitHub" used interchangeably, but it’s important to make the distinction that they are not the same.

Git is a version control application that must be installed on your computer to function. It lives locally on your machine and allows you to track changes to your project over time by creating snapshots (called commits). If something breaks, Git acts as your safety net, letting you look back at earlier versions or restore previous states of your project.

GitHub, on the other hand, is a cloud service. It stores your Git repositories online so they can be backed up, shared, and accessed remotely. Think of GitHub as the "cloud home" for the work you create using the Git application.

Before we can implement Git version control in our projects, we first need to ensure the application is installed on our local computers.
